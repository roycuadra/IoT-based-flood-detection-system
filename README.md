## Description

The IoT based flood detection with Blynk Integration code allows you to monitor distance measurements of water using an ultrasonic sensor connected to an ESP8266 microcontroller.
The measured distance in both centimeters and inches is displayed on the Blynk app for real-time visualization. Additionally, LEDs and a buzzer provide visual and audible alerts based on predefined distance conditions.
